#Pinions
Pinions is a ColdFusion library for compiling and serving web assets. 

It features declarative dependency management for JavaScript and CSS assets, 
as well as a powerful preprocessor pipeline that allows you to write assets in languages like 
CoffeeScript, Sass, SCSS and LESS.

This is inspired by Sprockets (Ruby).
